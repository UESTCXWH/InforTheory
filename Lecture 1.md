# Information Theory

The text book will be used in this course is "element of information theory" by T. Cover.  This book can be thought as a classical book which is used by many universies across the globe including MIT, Stanford, Berkeley.  We do not have enough time to cover all the materials of this book but we will cover the most important parts of it to give you a sense of what the information theory discusses about and what are the main applications of the theory.

Mainly we will cover :

1. chapter 1: which talks about what is the metric to qualitfy the information, i.e., entropy, and some important tools (Jensen's inequatlity , log sum inequality)
2. chapter 2 : AEP : which is the main properity for data compression
3. chapter 5:  we will talk about how to do the source coding, i..e, how to remove the redunence of the informaiton source, and what is the bound of the data compression
4. chapter 7: we will talk about the most important application of information theoryâ€”communication, what the channel capacity is and how to quantatively describe the capacity of a given channel
